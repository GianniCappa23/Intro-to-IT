<p>Growing up I had a few pets from dogs, cats, fish and a rabbit and currently I have 2 dogs (about to be 3) named Gigi and Molly who I would die for.</p>
<p>Throughout my life I have loved the outdoors and going on adventures to places with my family to places such as, Lorne, The Grampians and Echuca.</p>
<p>I have also been overseas to the U.S.A where I’ve been to places such as New York, LA, Las Vegas and more. Anyways I also am an athletic person and have played a lot of sports. The one I’m best at and my favourite to play is basketball.</p>
<p>Well that about everything interesting about my life.</p>
