<h2> About me </h2>

<p>Name: Gianni Capomolla</P>
<p>Student ID: s3960166</p>
<p>Student Email: s3960166@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<p>Growing up I had a few pets from dogs, cats, fish and a rabbit and currently I have 2 dogs (about to be 3) named Gigi and Molly who I would die for.Throughout my life I have loved the outdoors and going on adventures to places with my family to places such as, Lorne, The Grampians and Echuca. I have also been overseas to the U.S.A where I’ve been to places such as New York, LA, Las Vegas and more. Anyways I also am an athletic person and have played a lot of sports. The one I’m best at and my favourite to play is basketball. Well that about everything interesting about my life.</p>

<h3>My Interest in IT</h3>

<p>I have a really strong interest in IT because I find all things tech to amazing and unique in it’s own way. I love IT and tech especially stuff such as VR/AR, Robotics and Computers/Game Consoles. My interest in IT began from a young age, I was interested in most of not all tech due to me growing up in a house surrounded by things such as PlayStation’s, Nintendo’s, computers, robotic like toys and much more.</p>

<p>My interest in IT was not really sparked by a particular person or event. I would say that it was a range of people and experiences that sparked my interest in IT. Experiences like growing up with older brothers and playing PlayStation or our Nintendo DS’s helped spark my love for IT. Even growing up watching Youtubers like MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) where every video is about some new cool tech development and Gaming Youtubers such as Jacksepticeye and Pewdiepie helped grow my love for video games.</p>

<p>I chose to study at RMIT as I feel it matched many of my future ambitions in my life. RMIT is also a very flexible and a very supportive university so when I was doing my research choosing which university pathway I wanted, it was very helpful and reassuring to know that if I ever had an issue while studying at RMIT that there are a very wide range of useful support channels. RMIT also is giving me a wide range of skills to go right into my desired workforce and is not teaching me very niche and specific skills that  where employers may not need.</p>

<p>Through my studies at RMIT I expect to learn all of the skills that I need to be successful in my chosen workforce. Throughout my current and limited experience with RMIT, learning these specific workforce skills (in my case it is IT related skills) has met and sometimes exceeded my expectations going into my course. I also did not expect to also learn this but throughout my studies I have also learnt some life skills such as how to mange time appropriately and work in a team.</p>

<h4> My Ideal Job </h4>

<p> My ideal job in the IT industry would software developer. I love the idea of creating a program, app or game that helps someone or just brightens their day. The typical job of a software developer is to determine people’s needs and create computer programs that meet those certain needs. E.g. A hospital needs an app that makes sure that their employees are Covid negative, a software developer than creates an app or program where all the employees can upload their test results. Currently I only have about 3 weeks of programming and IT experience whereas the job requests “5 Years of of Software Developer experience”. However I plan on gaining this experience through studying at RMIT and getting a job in the IT/Programming industry to help further my current knowledge and hopefully gain new knowledge. Here is a job post that shows an example of a company that needs a software developer, what the job entails and the requirements:

<h5> My Personality Profile </h5>

<p>Learning Style Test: (http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml):</p>

<p>16 Personalities Test: (https://www.16personalities.com):</p>

<p>Big 5 Personality Test: (https://my-personality-test.com/results/3061798016054056824/big-5)</p>

<p>After completing the tests above the results show me where I’m strongest and where I may need to improve. For example, in the 16 personalities test it says that I am 79% introverted. From my perspective that means I need more extroverted so that will better my ability in working in a team in the future. However in the learning styles test it shows that my strong suit is in tactile and visual learning meaning that I am more likely to understand and do better in tasks that are more hands on.</p>

<p>I feel that now that I know that I am 79% introverted it lets me know that I need to be more open and expressive to others. So when I work in a group it will influence me as I know now and that I will be more extroverted when in groups setting for work or socially</p>

<p>I feel that I will take into account when forming a team in many ways. For example, I will try to surround myself with more extroverted people to help me open up and that will express how they feel about something in our work towards me which will help us all progress in the work</p>

<h6>My Project Idea</h6>

<p>My project idea is an app called Kurious Kids. The aim of this app is to help children explore the world and objects around them. The app rewards curious kids on their discoveries by giving them in app rewards. The app works as a point and scan through the child or parents built in camera on their respective devices.</p>

<p>I have chosen this to be my idea because growing up I was always a curious child and was always asking questions to my parents. In this day and age, more and more hand held devices such as phones and tablets are becoming more available and are in basically every child’s hand. So I feel that it would be very beneficial to take advantage of this rather sad fact and give children an app that is not also fun but very educational.</p>

<p>Kurious Kids is a place where children who may ponder what an object or thing is can simply and easily pull up the camera in the Kurious Kids app, take a picture of the object and the app does the rest. I recommend that the app be used by children who have just learnt or a just learning how to read as it also helps with their comprehension and helps expand their vocabulary.</p>

<p>The app provides easy to understand descriptions of whatever the child puts their curious mind to. The descriptions include, the name of the object, the colour of the object, what the objects function is and a fun fact about the object. For example, a child may not know what an object such as a coffee machine is. All they have to do is pull up the Kurious Kids app, point the camera at the object and take a picture of it. The app will then scan the image and provide the child with the descriptions mentioned above and the photo is automatically put into their camera role and stored within the app with the descriptions attached to it for easy access to look back on. The app also suggests a list objects that the child should seek out and scan in their environment. This is called “Scavenger Hunts”. Scavenger Hunts update weekly and it helps them to earn some of the in app currency.</p>

<p>Kurious Kids has a wide range of extra activities to keep kids entertained and to earn our previously mentioned in game currency. You’re probably wondering what this in game currency is since I keep mentioning it. In Kurious Kids our in game currency is called “Beanies”, which can be earned in a multitude of ways. The ways you can earn Beanies include, by generally scanning a previously undiscovered object, completing the weekly Scavenger Hunts and by correctly answering random pop up questions that happen every few times the child scans an object. In Kurious Kids these random pop up questions are called “Brain Busters” and as previously mentioned will pop up randomly after a child scans an object. Completing these Brain Busters will grant the child a certain amount of Beanies to spend in the in game store. The Beanies that are earned can be spend on items from the store that include, access to mini-games within the game or clothing and accessories to customise their avatars.</p>

<p>Some parents may feel that Kurious Kids is counter productive as we are trying to limit kids electronic use. However, Kurious Kids is a great way to motivate, stimulate and teach children the world that surrounds them especially if the parent may not be a present in the moment.</p>

<p>The software that will be used to created my app will be Unity. It is easy, intuitive and free to use and has been used with many major handheld games such as Pokemon Go. Kurious Kids will be originally made for iOS devices as that is what I have available and will either be made on an iOS device or my windows PC.</p>

<p>To create an app on a mobile device such as Kurious Kids is, you will need a range of software and programming skills. These skills include, experience with commonly used programming languages like C# and Java, being trained in web development languages like HTML 5 and CSS and many more. I feel that I will gain these skills to make the app through learning new skills in my Programming and IT classes at RMIT, researching techniques and watching guides and walkthroughs online.</p>

<p>I feel that the problem of kids being on and using their own or their parents devices at such a young age will never be solved and that it is on the parents to not give them the technology. However, from my point of view if we are going to give them access to these devices then the devices may as well be used as a learning tool and not a distraction. So the problem Kurious Kids will solve is that if a parent is busy or wants a quick distraction for their child that will also teach them a range of things then Kurious Kids is where to find it.</p>
